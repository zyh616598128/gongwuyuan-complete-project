#   Gradle start up script for POSIX generated by Gradle.
#
#   Important for running:
#
#   (1) You need a POSIX-compliant shell to run this script. If your /bin/sh is
#       noncompliant, find a compliant shell and set your SHELL environment
#       variable to its path.
#
#   Important for patching:
#
#   (2) This script is generated from the template file at
#       subprojects/plugins/src/main/resources/org/gradle/api/internal/plugins/unixStartScript.txt
#       within the Gradle project. You can find the latest version at
#       https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/HEAD/subprojects/plugins/src/main/resources/org/gradle/api/internal/plugins/unixStartScript.txt
#
#   (3) The script is only intended to be used by the Gradle wrapper. Do not
#       attempt to use this script independently of the wrapper, as it will
#       fail to resolve the location of the Gradle distribution necessary to
#       execute the gradle command.
#
#   (4) To learn more about the Gradle wrapper, visit
#       https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html
#
#   (5) To learn more about the Gradle wrapper properties that can be used to
#       customize the behavior of this script, visit
#       https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html#sec:configuration
